    The **Seattle Weather Dataset** provides historical data on weather conditions in Seattle. The dataset was originally published on Kaggle by [Ananth](https://www.kaggle.com/ananthr1), with the goal of enabling weather pattern analysis and prediction. It includes measurements for various weather attributes, providing insight into Seattle's diverse weather conditions.

    This dataset is widely used in machine learning for classification tasks, as it contains labeled weather conditions such as drizzle, rain, sun, snow, and fog. For each observation, features such as precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, and wind speed are recorded.

    ### Content
    The dataset consists of multiple rows, each representing a daily weather observation in Seattle. The primary attributes in the dataset are as follows:
    - **Precipitation**: The amount of precipitation recorded (in inches).
    - **Temp_Max**: Maximum daily temperature (in Fahrenheit).
    - **Temp_Min**: Minimum daily temperature (in Fahrenheit).
    - **Wind**: Wind speed recorded (in miles per hour).
    - **Weather**: Target variable indicating the type of weather observed (e.g., drizzle, rain, sun, snow, fog).

    The results from `df.describe()` provide key descriptive statistics for the Seattle weather dataset. First, the **precipitation** averages around {:.2f} inches with a standard deviation of {:.2f}, indicating some variation in rainfall levels throughout the year. **Maximum temperature**, meanwhile, has a mean of {:.2f} ¬∞F, with moderate variation around this average, while **minimum temperature** averages {:.2f} ¬∞F, suggesting consistent cooler ranges across seasons.

    When it comes to **wind speed**, the mean is approximately {:.2f} mph, showing a relatively steady distribution, though occasional spikes hint at windy days.

    Looking at minimum and maximum values, **precipitation** ranges from 0 up to higher levels during rainy days, and **temperature** varies significantly, reflecting the effects of seasonal change. Wind speed also exhibits some variability, indicating periods of high wind activity.

    The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles reveal a gradual increase across these features, demonstrating that this dataset captures a wide range of weather variables, which makes it well-suited for predictive modeling in weather classification.

                temperatures with a significant overlap between the two distributions. The minimum 
                temperatures on sunny days tend to have the largest spread, ranging from -7.1¬∞C to 18.3¬∞C, 
                which is quite large. As shown in the diagram, minimum temperatures are the coldest on the 
                days with snow, ranging from -4.3¬∞C up to 5.6¬∞C, meaning that snow occurs only on the 
                coldest days. Foggy conditions relate to a rather wide range of minimum temperatures 
                between -3.2¬∞C up to 17.8¬∞C, meaning fog can occur in a colder or warmer environment. 
                These patterns reveal a broad variability in minimum temperatures for each of the weather types,
                with particularly a large range on sunny days that also corresponds to some of the lowest and some
                of the highest minimum temperatures in the dataset.

             frequent weather conditions, that is mainly Rain and Sun, with 174 and 
             163 correct predictions respectively. It therefore means that the model

             Another class, Snow, happens by definition fewer times, and so prediction success is

             This performance suggests that, although the model is strong in common weather conditions

    Through exploratory data analysis and the application of machine learning techniques to weather data, several key insights and observations have emerged:

    #### 1. üìä **Weather Occurrences**:
    - Rainy and sunny weather types were the most frequent, dominating the observed period in Seattle. These weather patterns, due to their frequency, offer a reliable foundation for predictive models.

    #### 2. üìà **Temperature Trends**:
    - A clear seasonal pattern is present in the temperature data. Temperatures tend to drop significantly at the beginning and end of each year, coinciding with colder winters, while peaking in the middle, aligning with warmer summers.

    #### 3. üåßÔ∏è **Precipitation Trends**:
    - Precipitation data between 2012 and 2015 reveals significant variability, ranging from 0 to 55 inches. High precipitation levels were generally tied to rainy or snowy weather, with a more consistent correlation to rain.

    #### 4. üí® **Wind Speed Trends**:
    - Wind speeds fluctuated between 0 and 8 meters per second throughout the observation period. Windy conditions were more commonly seen during rainy or snowy weather, while calmer winds were observed in drizzle, sunny, and foggy weather.

    #### 5. ü§ñ **Machine Learning Model Insights**:
    - A Borderline-SMOTE technique was used to handle imbalanced data, oversampling minority features to improve model balance.
    - The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved an accuracy of around 80%. The model performed well in predicting sunny and rainy weather, though it struggled with drizzle, snow, and fog conditions. This was evident from the confusion matrix, which highlighted the model's lower accuracy for these weather types.
    - Further data on drizzle, snow, and fog conditions would likely improve prediction accuracy and allow the model to better handle the full spectrum of weather types.

    #### **Summing up**:
    The weather data analysis revealed key trends, with clear seasonal patterns and relationships between weather occurrences, temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The machine learning model showed promising accuracy for more common weather types but needs more data for less frequent conditions to enhance prediction performance. With further refinement and data collection, the model could achieve even better accuracy across all weather categories.
